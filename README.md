# 🎯 Student Record Management System

## 📄 Project Title:
**Student Record Management System**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Java**
- **OOP Concepts** (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism)
- **Eclipse IDE**
- **ArrayList**

## 📚 Project Description:
This is a console-based **Java application** that efficiently manages student records. The system allows users to:
- Add, view, search, update, delete, and sort student data based on marks.
- Implement core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to ensure clean and modular design.

### **Features:**
- **Dynamic student addition** using `ArrayList`
- **Grade calculation logic** using **Polymorphism**
- **Searching and updating** records based on unique student ID
- **Sorting student records** by marks
- **User-friendly Menu Driven Interface**

## 💻 Key OOP Concepts Applied:
### **Encapsulation:**
- Data hiding using private fields and public getters/setters to manage access to student details.

### **Inheritance:**
- Specialized classes extend base class properties to add unique functionality (e.g., `EngineeringStudent` extends `Student`).

### **Polymorphism:**
- Overriding grade calculation logic (`calculateGrade` method) for flexible behavior based on student marks.

### **Abstraction:**
- Hiding complex operations inside methods to focus on user interactions and clean code.

## 🎯 Sample Output:

```plaintext
--- MENU ---
1. Add Student
2. View All Students
3. Search by ID
4. Update Marks
5. Delete Student
6. Sort by Marks
7. Exit
